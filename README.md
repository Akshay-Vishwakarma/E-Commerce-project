A complete relational database project for an e-commerce system with tables, sample data, and 25+ SQL queries for real-world insights and analysis. 💻📊
E-Commerce Database Project using MySQL

This project simulates a real-world e-commerce system with a well-structured relational database. 🛒
It includes four main tables: product, customers, orders, and order_details — all linked with primary and foreign keys for data integrity. 🔗
The product table stores details like product name, category, price, and stock quantity. 📋
The customers table holds customer information including names, email IDs, addresses, and contact numbers. 📧🏠📞
Orders placed by customers are recorded in the orders table with order dates and total amounts. 🗓️💰
The order_details table captures detailed information about each product in an order, such as quantity and price. 📊
This database design follows best practices to ensure efficient data storage and easy retrieval. ✅
Sample data is inserted to demonstrate real-world scenarios including multiple categories like Electronics, Furniture, and Jewelry. 💻🛋️💍
The project includes over 25 SQL queries for analyzing data — like finding top products, customer spending, stock levels, and order summaries. 🔍📈
Queries cover basics like retrieving data, filtering, joins, aggregates (SUM, AVG, COUNT), and subqueries. 🎯
Indexes are created on important columns like product price for faster query performance. ⚡
It also shows how to create views for summarizing customer spending and product sales. 👀
This project is great for anyone learning MySQL, data modeling, or e-commerce analytics. 📚💡
You can practice writing complex SQL queries and understand relationships between tables in a business context. 🤓
Feel free to explore the code, run the queries, and customize it as per your learning needs! 🛠️
If you find it helpful, don’t forget to ⭐ the repo and share with fellow learners. 🌟

Conclusion:
This project helped me understand how to design relational databases, enforce data integrity using keys, and write efficient SQL queries to gain business insights. It strengthened my practical skills in data modeling and analytics, which are essential for any data-driven role. 🚀📊
